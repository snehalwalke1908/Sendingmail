# Description:
This is an Email that sends emails using Swagger UI template and an API. It was built to avoid development teams having to configure mail over and over on projects involving a micro-services infrastructure.

It is built using [Django-Rest Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) and a Docker file is included for easy development. 
Documentation is managed by Swagger with the drf-yasg module.
